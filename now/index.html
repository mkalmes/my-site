    <p><em>Updated on 2025&#8211;12&#8211;16 at Home</em></p>

    <h2 id="overallstate">Overall State</h2>

    <p>Still ongoing health related topics and still doctor appointments scheduled for the last stretch of the year.</p>

    <p>My sport routine changed to mix of 30-minute HIIT rides on my ergometer, Pialtes, body weight strength training and Yoga. Stretching gets more and more important for me. I&#8217;m now working out six times per week and try to get the new routine dialed in.</p>

    <h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Foundation S3. This is a series I&#8217;m watching with a good friend, and we have only three episodes left.</li>
    <li>Star Trek: Next Generation. Only watching if the mood strikes.</li>
    <li>One Piece: I gave in and bought a Crunchy Roll subscription during black week. I&#8217;ve watched a couple of episodes with german dub but never with the japanese dub. This is something I will not finish anytime soon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

    <p>I&#8217;m not traveling for the rest of 2025 but haven&#8217;t finished my lighter reads yet.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The Tusks of Extinction by Ray Nayler</li>
    <li>Listening to Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I&#8217;m also reading &#8220;Tiny Experiments&#8221; by Anne-Laure Le Cunff and &#8220;How to Think Like a Roman Emperor&#8221; by Donald J. Robertson .</p>
