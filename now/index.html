    <h2 id="overallstate">Overall State</h2>

    <p>Ongoing health related topics (nothing serious) and seeing many doctors. Sucks to clear the calendar for appointments and then playing catchup to put my hours in for the jobby job.</p>

    <p>Cycling on my ergometer four times a week (if I&#8217;m not traveling).</p>

    <h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Star Trek: Next Generation. Currently in Season 2. Haven&#8217;t watched it in many years.</li>
    <li>Foundation S3. This is a series I&#8217;m watching with a good friend, but we hadn&#8217;t the chance to schedule something but eager to pick it up again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

    <p>When I travel between my home and the north of Germany I enjoy some entertaining and light reads.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The Tusks of Extinction by Ray Nayler</li>
    <li>Listening to Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I&#8217;m also reading &#8220;How to Think Like a Roman Emperor&#8221; by Donald J. Robertson and &#8220;Tiny Experiments&#8221; by Anne-Laure Le Cunff.</p>
